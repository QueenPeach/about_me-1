            <h1 class="large-text">About Me:</h1>
            <p class="small-text">
                I moved to Seattle 6 years ago from Omaha, NE after graduating from University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
                After moving to Seattle I started working as a Computer Engineer at a Fiber Optics company writing
                deviced drivers in C for a proprietary operating system and developer tools in Python.
            </p>
            <p class="small-text">
                In my spare time, I met my current wife, Natasha and we started riding bicycles, sailing, and generally
                taking advantage of all the outdoor activities that Seattle has to offer. During this time, I became
                obsessed with building road bikes using vintage steel frames acquired off various auction sites and
                modern components. I built four steel framed bicycles from the frame up including a 1974 Schwinn, a 1970s Chesini
                Arena, 1961 Legnano, and a 1970s Windsor Professional.
            </p>
            <p class="small-text">
                More recently, I developed another hobby of collecting, building, and tweaking mechanical keyboards. This
                is definitely a niche hobby although among the PC gaming community in South Korea it has become incredibly
                popular.
            </p>
            <p class="small-text">
                I'm generally interested in most tech and I really do like playing video games when I have the time. This was
                inspiration for me to acquire a raspberry pie and put the RetroPi image on it with some of my favorite vintage
                games. This turned out to be a great thing to play old games with friends on holidays.

            <p class="small-text">
                Currently, my primary goals are to finish the Code Fellows program including 201, 301, and 401. Once finished,
                I hope to obtain a career as a Full Stack developer at a fun startup company with lots of interesting problems
                to work on. A secondary goal of mine is to finish a Python port of the GNU stow program which I use to deploy
                all my dotfiles stored on Github.
